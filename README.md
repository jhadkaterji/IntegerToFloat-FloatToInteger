# IntegerToFloat-FloatToInteger
This program implements two functions for converting between IEEE single precision floating-point and 32-bit two's complement integers



Requirements: 
The i2f routine should take one 32-bit integer as its only argument and should return a 32-bit integer. However, the return value should be interpreted to be actually an IEEE single-precision floating-point value. The return value should be the result of converting the input integer value to IEEE single-precision floating point. The conversion should be implemented using only integer operations. Be sure to handle negative input values.

The f2i routine should take one 32-bit integer as its only argument and should return a 32-bit integer. However, the input value should be interpreted to be actually an IEEE single-precision floating-point value. The return value should be the result of converting the input value to 32-bit two's complement integer. The conversion should be implemented using only integer operations. Be sure to handle negative, NaN, infinity and denormalized input floating-point values.
